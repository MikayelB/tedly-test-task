# What is it?
We prepared this minimal boilerplate, so you can start implementing the designs with all the required configs for code style and Next.js environment. 

Fork this repo and send us a link to the repo with your results.

**Figma Designs:** https://www.figma.com/design/kWCDsTa2RanRMgyynVWagA/Project-Table---Test-Task?node-id=0-1&p=f

## Task
 - Implement "Add Project" functionality 
 - Implement the provided UI as much as you can
 - Implement "Add Project" API request
 - Implement "Get Project" API request 

## Requirements
 - Use ReactJS (NextJS)
 - Use Node.js (preferred Stapi.JS, PostgresSQL)
 - Use Redux Toolkit as state management tool
 - will be a plus if you use Tailwind for styling
 - Show us best practices you know 
 - Will be a plus if you implement filters and search

 ## Do not do
 - Left menu functionality (only create ui)
 - Header functionality (only create ui)

## Anything else?
If you think that there are not enough details in some part of the task, just implement it the way you think it should be.

Be careful! We expect you to extract as much information from the designs as possible.
